== Description ==

The WP101® Video Tutorial Plugin is simply the easiest way to teach your clients WordPress basics, cutting your support costs while providing an invaluable resource for your clients. It delivers a library of professionally-produced, WordPress 101 tutorial videos directly within your client’s own dashboard.

In addition to video tutorials for WordPress (both Gutenberg and Classic Editor), we're continually expanding our library with video tutorials for the most popular WordPress plugins, including WooCommerce, Elementor, Beaver Builder, Ninja Forms, and WPForms.

Simply enter your [WP101Plugin.com](https://wp101plugin.com/) API key to display our WordPress tutorial videos within your client’s WordPress administration panel.

You can choose which tutorial videos to show in the list, or even embed your own custom videos.

Stop wasting your valuable time teaching WordPress to your clients. Let the WP101 Plugin free your time to do what you do best!

== Installation ==

1. Go to [WP101Plugin.com](https://wp101plugin.com/) to get your API key.
2. Copy your API key from your [WP101Plugin.com](https://app.wp101plugin.com/) dashboard.
3. Install and activate the WP101 Plugin in the 'Plugins' panel.
4. Go to the Video Tutorials menu item and click the Settings button to enter your API key.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get an API key? =

Simply go to: [WP101Plugin.com](https://wp101plugin.com/) and follow the instructions to set up an API key in less than a minute.

= Can I choose which video topics are displayed? =

Yes! You can selectively hide or show individual tutorial videos (or entire courses) through the app at [WP101Plugin.com](https://app.wp101plugin.com).

= Can I add my own custom videos? =

Yes! You can add your own custom videos, and they'll appear at the bottom of the list of tutorial videos. Visit the “Custom Videos” page in the [WP101 Plugin app](https://app.wp101plugin.com/custom-topics).

= What if I have the Classic Editor installed? =

If the Classic Editor plugin is also installed and activated on your site, the previous version of our WordPress 101 videos for the Classic Editor in WordPress 4.9 and older will also appear in the list. You can hide or show these videos in the Settings.

= Why aren’t the videos for WooCommerce, WPForms, etc. showing up? =

The tutorial videos for WooCommerce, Ninja Forms, WPForms and other plugins will only appear in the list if the plugin in question is also installed and activated on the same site. No sense showing videos that don’t apply to a particular site, right?

= The plugin was installed by my developer, but their API key has expired. What do I do? =

You can ask your developer to renew their subscription, or you can go to [WP101Plugin.com](https://wp101plugin.com/) to start your own Personal subscription and get access to all of our videos.

= Can I hardcode my API key into the plugin for use across multiple installations?  =

Yes! Simply define the `WP101_API_KEY` constant within your `wp-config` file:

    /**
     * API key for the WP101 plugin.
     *
     * @link https://wp101plugin.com
     */
    define( 'WP101_API_KEY', 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' );

== Screenshots ==

1. The video tutorial selection and viewing interface.
2. Add your own custom videos and deploy them to one or more sites.
3. Choose to hide or show individual videos—or an entire series—on a per-domain basis.
4. Manage all your client domains remotely, from one dashboard.
5. With an Agency Plan, you can also embed the 31-part WordPress 101 video series on the front-end of your membership site.
6. Use one API key across all your sites, or generate unique API keys as needed.
